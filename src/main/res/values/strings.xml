        party network such as Facebook Audience Network and Google Admob when serving Ads, as well as Firebase Analytics from Google which may collect information from users.</string>
    <string name="parentsguide_text2">How can I manage or turn off In-app-purchase?</string>
    <string name="parentsguide_text3">This game is free to download and play, but contains In-app-purchases:\n\n\t\t-Remove Ads\n\t\t-Purchasing Jewels\n\nThese
        purchases are never required to play the game, but can be used to enhance the gameplay. In-app-purchase are paid for with real money, and are always
        labeled as such. You can easily manage the ability to make in-app-purchase, adjust password protection settings, or disable in-app-purchase entirely. To do so,
        open Google Playstore on your device, and go to \'User controls\' section in the Playstore Settings page. This can prevent your child from making unintentional in-app-purchase.</string>
    <string name="parentsguide_text4">Who processes the In-app-purchase transactions?</string>
    <string name="parentsguide_text5">We do not handle the In-app-purchase transactions. The payment transactions themselves are completed through Google Play via
        your personal email address associated with that account. Receipts for these transactions are emailed to you by Google.\n\nTherefore, we do not have
        access to any of your personal and credit card information, as the transaction are completed through Google Play.</string>
